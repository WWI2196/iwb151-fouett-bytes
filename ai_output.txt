* The Euro (EUR) is likely to show a bullish trend, as it is expected to benefit from the ECB's interest rate cut and the RBI's scenario planning.
* The US Dollar (USD) is likely to show a bearish trend, as it may face challenges from the US-China trade tensions and the increasing risk of a global currency war.
* The Japanese Yen (JPY) is likely to show a neutral trend, as it may benefit from the Chinese central bank's plan for supporting stock markets.

* The Swiss Franc (CHF) is likely to be supported by the ECB's interest rate cut, as it may benefit from the Swiss market's positive sentiment.
* The Australian Dollar (AUD) is likely to be affected by the Chinese central bank's plan for supporting stock markets, as it may face challenges from the ongoing trade tensions between Australia and China.
